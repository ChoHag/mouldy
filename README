My Opinionated Unix & Linux Distribution

This is, maybe, going to become a distribution of unix & linux for
building atop of. It consists of the kernel of your choice, a C library,
compiler and binary utils. The ultimate goal is remove all of the GNU
components. MOULD is not GNU.

If anyone can think of what the Y can stand for then please let me know.


You will need:

A working unix environment. This was initially developed from within
Debian 9.2.

GCC 4.2.1 sources (patched).

Binutils 2.29 sources.

musl (tested with v1.1.18).

GNU make 4.2 sources.

Disc space and patience. I count 2.5GB uncompressed after the build
completed and 45 minutes on my shitty little laptop.

Knowledge and common sense.


Build instructions:

Modify build to your liking and run it. If everything works then
'yes | build' will create a directory 'fs-x86_64' in your home
directory containing the build & compilation parts of mould's root
filesystem. If it doesn't all work then fix it and try again.
